# Username-Generator
This Python script generates a random username by combining a user-provided first and last name with a randomly generated string of alphanumeric characters. The user inputs their full name and desired username length, and the program creates a unique username by appending a random string to their name. It utilizes the random and string modules to create the random characters.

How It Works:
The program prompts the user to enter their first and last name.
The user specifies the desired length of the random string.
The program generates a username by combining the provided name with a randomly generated string of characters (letters and digits).
The username is then displayed on the screen.
